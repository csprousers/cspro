MP4v2 Library
=============

This library provides functions to read, create, and modify mp4 files

We use a fork of mp4v2 from here: https://github.com/CSProDevelopment/mp4v2. This version was modified for cross-compilation for Android

To build on Windows use the solution file in the mp4v2-Win folder.

To build for Android run the script androidBuildReleaseLibs.sh. You will need to run this on Linux/MacOS. It should work on Windows with WSL. You will need to install the Android NDK and automake.
