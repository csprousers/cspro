95004  Consider using a variable-length 'string' instead of a fixed-length 'alpha' for alphanumeric variables
95005  The Path.selectFile function may not be supported in future versions of CSPro. Use the CS.Path.selectFile function instead.
95006  The htmlDialog function may not be supported in future versions of CSPro. Use the CS.UI.showDialog function instead.
