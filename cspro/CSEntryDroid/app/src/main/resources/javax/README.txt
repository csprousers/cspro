The javax.obex files were copied from the Android Open Source project.

Specifically they were retrevied from:
	https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base.git
	Commit c565a5675ac33d97d5c1caed7a5629412997fb4a (Jan 30 2015)

While the obex code is built into Android (and used in the built-in
bluetooth file-transfer) it is not exposed through any public API.
Thankfully it has an open source license so we are able to use it.

See the file NOTICE for license information.
