============================================================================

    [1]  What's New in This Version

    -  Many specification files have been redesigned using JSON formats,
       which facilitates working with them in other programming languages or
       when using other tools. Once you save files in this format, you will
       not be able to work with them in earlier versions of CSPro.

    -  Dictionary items can be specified using four new data types:
          * Audio
          * Document
          * Geometry
          * Image

    -  Binary dictionary items are an experimental feature and these items
       can be used in a limited way in logic and cannot be added to forms
       (for this release), but are otherwise supported throughout CSPro,
       including as part of synchronizations.

    -  The introduction of Action Invoker, a system of running actions
       in a standard way from CSPro logic, embedded JavaScript, CSCode,
       and from JavaScript executed on web pages displayed by CSPro.

    -  A new view, questionnaire view, displays the contents of a case and
       its components (dictionary, forms, question text) in a read-only mode
       that facilitates reviewing or printing.

    -  The introduction of a new version of logic that enhances the
       ability to work with string literals and newline characters, and
       positions the syntax of CSPro logic closer to other languages.

    -  A new tool, CSCode, is a text editor with support for running
       JavaScript, designing and testing HTML dialogs, validating
       specification files, and more.

    -  A new tool, CSView, displays files in a web browser that has access
       to the Action Invoker.

    -  A new tool, CSDocument, allows users to author documents using a
       simple, limited, markup language. Documents and Document Sets
       can be exported to HTML, PDF, and CHM (Compiled HTML Help) formats.

    -  The Pack Application tool has been redesigned and supports packing
       multiple applications or inputs. Pack specifications can be saved
       to a .cspack file, and production packs can now be run on Android.

    -  The persistent variable modifier allows logic variables to retain
       their values from one run of an application to another.

    -  A new data source, JSON, allows cases to be stored in JSON format
       in a file comprising a single JSON array of case objects. The data
       source allows duplicate cases (like CSPro DB) but does not support
       synchronization.

    -  Listing files and frequencies can now be written to JSON format.

    -  Table Viewer can display charts for tables generated by the
       Tabulate Frequencies tool.

    -  Language additions:
          * compareNoCase
          * Barcode functions: createQRCode
          * Case functions: view
          * Image functions: createQRCode
          * Item functions: getValueLabel, hasValue, isValid
          * Map functions: clear
          * Symbol functions: getJson, getLabel, getName, getValueJson,
              updateValueFromJson

    -  Action Invoker additions:
          * execute, registerAccessToken
          * Application: getFormFile, getQuestionnaireContent,
              getQuestionText
          * Clipboard: getText, putText
          * Data: getCase
          * Dictionary: getDictionary
          * File: copy, readBytes, readLines, readText, writeBytes,
              writeLines, writeText
          * Hash: createHash, createMd5
          * Localhost: mapActionResult, mapFile, mapSymbol, mapText
          * Logic: getSymbol, getSymbolMetadata, getSymbolValue, eval,
              invoke, updateSymbolValue
          * Message: formatText, getText
          * Path: createDirectory, getDirectoryListing, getPathInfo,
              getSpecialPaths, selectFile, showFileDialog
          * Settings: getValue, putValue
          * Sqlite: close, exec, open, rekey
          * System: getSharableUri, selectDocument
          * UI: alert, closeDialog, getDisplayOptions, getInputData,
              getMaxDisplayDimensions, enumerateWebViews, postWebMessage,
              setDisplayOptions, showDialog, view

    -  Bug fixes and enhancements.

============================================================================

    [2]  Migrating Previous Applications to 8.0

    Nearly all previous CSPro applications should work in CSPro 8.0 with
    the exception of compiled data entry applications (.enc) created prior
    to CSPro 6.0. These applications must be regenerated using CSPro 8.0.
    These compiled applications will now have the extension .pen and can
    also be run on Android devices running the CSEntry application.

    Data files in CSPro DB (.csdb) format created in versions prior to 8.0
    can be used with this version. However, due to a file format change,
    CSPro DB files created in version 8.0 cannot be used in versions earlier
    than 7.4. To use CSPro DB files in earlier versions of CSPro, convert
    the file to text format and then convert it back to CSPro DB format
    using an earlier version of CSPro.

============================================================================

============================================================================

    [5]  Example Files and Folders

    CSPro comes with several example programs to help you learn about the
    software's functionality. The examples are in a subfolder of the
    Documents folder, "CSPro\Examples 8.0." You can also view the examples
    folder via a link on the Help menu in the CSPro Designer.

============================================================================

    [6]  What was New in CSPro 7.7

    -  Addition of a logic-based reporting system in which HTML reports,
       editable in the CSPro Designer, can include logic fills and can
       use logic to control what parts of the report are generated.

    -  Ability to take photos, capture signatures, and resample images in
       logic using the new Image object.

    -  Ability to display and manipulate vector geometry (points, lines, and
       polygons) using the Geometry object. You can interactively trace
       polygons and compute a polygon's area and perimeter.

    -  Ability to work with binary files using the Document object.

    -  CSPro functions can be executed by using JavaScript from reports,
       question text, and while viewing web pages.

    -  Introduction of HTML dialogs for displaying logic functions (such as
       errmsg and accept) as well as other aspects of the CSPro user
       interface (UI). The htmldialog function allows users to create new UI
       elements using HTML and JavaScript.

    -  Windows uses the Leaflet mapping system to implement the mapping
       features previously available only on Android.

    -  The gps function can be used to capture GPS coordinates in an
       interactive mode where details about the current GPS reading are
       shown or in a mode where an enumerator can select a location on a
       map.

    -  A new capture type, toggle button, presents field data with two
       states (selected and not selected).

    -  Batch applications can output data to multiple data sources during
       the same application run.

    -  New write-only data sources allow data to be written directly to
       several native formats, including:
          * Comma-Separated Values (CSV)
          * Excel
          * R
          * SAS (using transport files)
          * SPSS
          * Stata

    -  External logic files are now editable in the CSPro Designer. The
       logic editor also now supports code folding.

    -  The text color of value set labels can be specified.

    -  Aliases can be defined in the dictionary editor.

    -  The Export Data and Tabulate Frequencies tools allow you to specify
       the dictionary language that is used when exporting labels or
       creating frequency tables.

    -  On Android, a new file sharing interface allows third-party
       applications to overcome security restrictions in order to access
       or modify files in the csentry directory.

    -  Language additions:
          * currentkey, htmldialog, inadvance, invoke, setbluetoothname,
            synctime
          * Document functions: clear, load, save, view
          * Geometry functions: area, clear, getProperty, load, maxLatitude,
              maxLongitude, minLatitude, minLongitude, perimeter, save,
              setProperty, tracePolygon, walkPolygon
          * Image functions: captureSignature, clear, height, load,
              resample, save, takePhoto, view, width
          * Map functions: addGeometry, clearGeometry, removeGeometry,
              saveSnapshot
          * Path functions: getRelativePath, selectFile
          * Report functions: save, view, write

    -  Bug fixes and enhancements.

============================================================================

    [7]  What was New in CSPro 7.6

    -  New capture types for Android, including barcode (for scanning
       numeric or string barcodes using the device's camera), and slider
       (for capturing numeric range values using a graphical slider).

    -  CAPI question text is now stored in HTML format instead of the
       old RTF format. This allows for the creation of dynamic question text
       with support for images, tables, hyperlinks, and other HTML elements.
       Question text will automatically be upgraded to the new format when
       opening applications designed in previous versions of CSPro.

    -  Question text fills can now include any logic expression. Instead of
       using %...% for a fill, you now use ~~...~~. Question text conditions
       are also based on logic expressions, so using the full set of CSPro
       logic functions is now possible when working with question text.

    -  The following tools can now be run on Android:
          * Compare Data
          * Concatenate Data
          * Index Data
          * Paradata Concatenator
          * Reformat Data
          * Sort Data

    -  Listing files can now be written as Excel or HTML files.

    -  Enhanced ability to generate frequencies, including controlling when
       they are tallied and how they are displayed. Frequencies can be
       written as text and tables (as before) in addition to the new Excel
       and HTML formats. They can also be used in data entry applications.

    -  A new feature in the logic editor, Symbol Analysis, shows where each
       dictionary symbol, form symbol, and user-defined function is used in
       your application.

    -  Language additions:
          * Freq functions: clear, save, tally, view

    -  Bug fixes and enhancements.

============================================================================

    [8]  What was New in CSPro 7.5

    -  Ability to record and play audio on Android devices in two modes:
       interactive mode, with the enumerator able to control the recording;
       and background mode, with the recording controlled by logic
       functions using the new Audio object.

    -  The csentry directory on Android has moved. For new installations
       the csentry directory will be located at:

       <external storage>/Android/data/gov.census.cspro.csentry/files/csentry

       If you are upgrading from an earlier version of CSEntry, the
       csentry directory will remain at <external storage>/csentry.
       This change is required to support the more stringent security
       requirements introduced in the latest versions of Android.

    -  CSWeb can convert case data to MySQL/MariaDB relational tables using
       a command line process, allowing for more dynamic reporting.

    -  Listing files can now be written as CSV or CSPro data files (in
       addition to the familiar text format).

    -  New HashMap object that allows for the use of an associative array
       in logic.

    -  Ability to synchronize paradata between devices over Bluetooth or
       by using a Dropbox, CSWeb, or FTP server.

    -  User-defined functions now support optional parameters as well as
       passing numeric and string values by reference.

    -  The language now has a preprocessor, which allows for conditional
       compilation of logic.

    -  Language additions:
          * encode, OnSystemMessage, replace, syncparadata
          * Audio functions: clear, concat, length, load, play, record,
              recordInteractive, save, stop,
          * HashMap functions: clear, contains, getKeys, length, remove
          * List functions: sort, removeDuplicates, removeIn
          * Path functions: concat, getDirectoryName, getExtension,
              getFilename, getFilenameWithoutExtension
          * ValueSet functions: randomize, sort

    -  Bug fixes and enhancements.

============================================================================

       the disk.

    -  Downloading data from CSWeb servers using Data Viewer is faster.

    -  Saved passwords are encrypted when saved on Android devices in
       addition to being stored in a secure location.

    -  Ability to clear saved synchronization and data source credentials.

    -  Language additions:
          * filetime, hash, ischecked, OnRefused, OnSyncMessage, protect,
            refused, startswith, syncapp, syncmessage, when
          * Barcode functions: read
          * SystemApp functions: clear, getResult, exec, setArgument

    -  A new tool, Deploy Application, for creating application packages
       that can be deployed to mobile devices.

    -  A new logic function, warning, that can be used instead of errmsg
       for "soft check" error messages. These will not be displayed to an
       operator when advancing in the case (e.g., resuming from a partial
       save).

    -  Support for multiple language messages in the message file and
       a way to translate string literals with the tr function.

    -  Multiple message files can be associated with an application.

          * loadsetting, savesetting, uuid

    -  Bug fixes and small enhancements, particularly on Android devices.

============================================================================

    [15] What was New in CSPro 6.2

    -  Dictionaries can now have labels in multiple languages, facilitating
       data collection in more than one language.

    -  Value sets can have associated images that display along with the
       value label when using extended controls.

    -  Applications can define resource folders that contain auxiliary files
       that the application uses. These files will be compressed in the
       .pen file and decompressed when running the application.

    -  Field and occurrence labels will by default be linked to the labels
       defined in the dictionary, which will help keep labels synced.

    -  The Windows extended controls have been improved, with navigation
       buttons and search functionality.

    -  Android case tree changes: individual fields can be hidden in the
       tree; by default skipped fields will no longer be shown in the tree.

    -  System messages as defined in CSProRuntime.mgf can be overridden.

    -  Language additions:
          * connection, getimage, prompt, round

    -  Bug fixes and small enhancements.

============================================================================

    [16] What was New in CSPro 6.1

    -  On Android tablets, the case tree now appears alongside the
       questions, resulting in simplified navigation.

    -  Improved synchronization setup: There is a step-by-step interface
       for creating basic synchronization files for applications.

    -  Bluetooth synchronization: In addition to Dropbox and FTP, now data
       can be transmitted via a peer-to-peer Bluetooth connection.

    -  Sync from logic: Using the sync function, synchronization routines
       can be run or queued to run at a later time.

    -  Applications can be created using a new CAPI Data Entry Application
       mode that automatically sets the recommended parameters for CAPI
       applications.

    -  French and Spanish translations of the Android menus.

    -  The field colors displayed in CSEntry on Windows can be modified.

    -  Multiple parameters can be specified in a .pff file and accessed
       via the sysparm function.

    -  A tool has been added to CSPro:
          * Excel to CSPro: Use this tool to convert data stored in Excel
            to a format that CSPro can read (for example when creating
            lookup files from preexisting data).

    -  Language additions:
          * dircreate, direxist, dirlist, getdeviceid, publishdate,
            setocclabel, sync

============================================================================

    [17] What was New in CSPro 6.0

    -  Android support: The CSPro engine was rewritten so that it can run
       on both Windows and Android devices. CSEntry is available for
       download in the Google Play store. Data entry programs are still
       created on Windows but can now run on both operating systems.

    -  The Android application has a synchronization tool that allows
       applications and data files to be synched with Dropbox or on an FTP
       server.

    -  The previous compiled data entry .enc format has been superseded with
       a new format with the extension .pen.

    -  The default extension of CSPro logic files is now .apc, changed from
       .app. Many email clients blocked attachments that contained .app
       files, which made emailing CSPro applications difficult. CSPro can
       still run old applications that use the .app extension.

    -  A new string type has been added to logic. This type is similar to
       the alpha type except that it is of variable length, meaning that
       the string can grow and shrink in size, depending on what is
       assigned to it.

    -  Alpha and string variables can be declared locally in PROCs and
       functions. (This was already possible with numeric variables.)

    -  Strings can be concatenated using the + operator, eliminating the
       need for the concat function.

    -  The rules governing the drop down and combo boxes have changed, with
       drop downs now only supporting discrete value sets, whereas combo
       boxes can show ranges. When opening old applications, CSPro will
       automatically convert drop down fields with ranges to combo boxes.

    -  The random number functions produce a different sequence of values,
       even with a seed, than in previous versions of CSPro.

    -  A new data entry mode for tablets hides both the case tree and
       CSEntry's menus, maximizing screen real estate for forms.

    -  Several tools have been added to CSPro:
          * PFF Editor: Use this tool to edit .pff files with a
            convenient graphical user interface that shows all options
            that can be customized.

          * Production Runner: Use this tool to automate the running of
            several CSPro operations that you want to run in sequence.

          * Operator Statistics Viewer: Use this tool to easily view keying
            logs, to chart the progress of a keying operation, and to
            forecast completion dates.

          * Save Array Viewer: Use this tool to view or edit the contents
            of hotdecks (save arrays) created by a batch editing program.

    -  Language additions:
          * getocclabel, getos, getvalue, getvaluealpha,
            getvaluenumeric, setvalue, showarray

    -  Bug fixes and small enhancements.

============================================================================

    [18] What was New in CSPro 5.0

    -  Internationalization. CSPro now supports non-Latin languages. This
       is a large change to CSPro and even affects users who use only Latin
       languages. Read the "Unicode Primer" in the help documentation for
       more information on how this change will affect you.

    -  Data and specification files are saved in UTF-8 encoding instead
       of ASCII/ANSI format.

    -  A PDA (PocketPC) version is no longer supported.

    -  New multiline alpha fields, useful for addresses, memos, or notes.

    -  The tickmarks on alpha fields can be removed to support scripts with
       connecting features, such as Arabic, or scripts where multiple
       keystrokes comprise one character, such as Devanagari.

    -  A number pad control has been added to facilitate data entry of
       numeric values on tablets.

    -  Text labels can now be span multiple lines.

    -  Entry in rosters can be from right-to-left, for languages such
       as Arabic.

    -  Data entry and exports support the use of a comma as a decimal mark.

    -  Users can modify the font used in the CSPro Designer.

    -  The position of extended control popups can be set in form properties.

    -  The starting language for CAPI applications can be specified in a
       a data entry PFF file.

    -  Data files can be exported to R format.

    -  It is possible to include data files in packed applications.

    -  Tabulation: Area names can be suppressed (as in IMPS) and spanners
       can be added to tables.

    -  Language additions:
          * alias, changekeyboard, dateadd, datevalid, fileempty, has,
            onchangelanguage, onchar, seekmax, seekmin, setoutput

    -  Bug fixes and small enhancements.

    ===========
    -  SEPARATE RECORD EXPORT IN SPSS, SAS, and STATA.  You can now export
       different records types to different files where multiple records
       in the input file produce multiple records in the output files.
       This was available for text and comma delimited file previously and
       is now available for SPSS, SAS, and STATA exports.

    Pack Application
    ================
    -  NEW.  This new tools allows you to create a zip file containing all the
       files that belong to an application.  This is useful to transfer an
       application to another computer or to another colleague.

    [27] What was New in CSPro 2.4

    Those of you who are already familiar with CSPro 2.3 should note the
    following significant changes and new features.  Please refer to the
    CSPro documentation or helps for more information.


    CSPro (Data Entry Designer)
    ===========================
    -  DATA ENTRY OPTIONS.   You can allow partial saves of cases and show
       the case tree by selecting these options under the data entry options
       dialog box (Ctrl+E).


    CSPro (language)
    ================
    -  GETNOTE, PUTNOTE, EDITNOTE functions.  These functions allow you to
       read and write notes to the notes file and force the operator to enter
       or read a note.  They can only be coded in data entry applications.

    -  MAKETEXT function.  This function allow you to create a formatted
       string within your logic.

    -  ONFOCUS and KILLFOCUS procedures.  These procedures are only executed
       in data entry applications.  They allow you to define statements which
       are always executed prior to and following entry of a level, roster,
       or field.


    CSEntry (Data Entry Module)
    ===========================
    -  You can now save notes which are associated with a particular field
       within a particular case.

    -  A case can now be partially saved in Add, Modify, or Verify mode.
       When this feature is turned on, you can stop anytime during the entry
       of a case and come back to it later.  You will have the choice of
       beginning at the position in the case where you left off, or at the
       first keyable field of the case.

    -  A case tree has been added for navigation within a case.  When this
       feature is turned on, a tree showing the names and values of data items
       within the case is displayed.  It can be used for moving between data
       items or for examining what has been entered in the case.

    -  The menus and keyboard shortcuts have been changed and augmented.  In
       particular, the Functions menu item has been split into Edit and
       Navigation menus.  Additional items have been added to the View menu.


    CSPro (all modules)
    ===================
    -  BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY.  You can open any application created in
       CSPro 2.2 or 2.3 in CSPro 2.4.

============================================================================

    [28] What was New in CSPro 2.3

    Those of you who are already familiar with CSPro 2.2 should note the
    following significant changes and new features.  Please refer to the
    CSPro documentation or helps for more information.


    CSPro (Data Entry Designer)
    ===========================
    -  COLOR IN FORMS.  You now have total control over the colors you use in
       your data entry applications.  Each form can have its own color, and
       every text item can have its own color.

    -  MORE ALIGNMENT FUNCTIONS FOR FORMS DESIGN.  In addition to aligning
       things left, right, top and bottom, you can now center things and space
       them evenly.


    CONCATENATE DATA UTILITY
    ========================
    -  This utility allows you to concatenate (join together) as many data
       files (or text files) as you like.  The data files can be from any
       folder and you can sort them in a variety of ways.  You'll find it on
       the CSPro's Tools menu.


    CSPro (language)
    ================
    -  INSERT/DELETE/SORT COMMANDS.  These are new commands in the CSPro
       language, which provide you more power in manipulating your data files.

    -  DECLARING VARIABLES IN YOUR LOGIC.  Variables that are not declared in
       PROC GLOBAL will be flagged as errors to help you avoid unintentional
       errors in your logic.  If you prefer, you can easily set the compiler
       not to flag these as errors, as in CSPro 2.2.  See the CSPro
       documentation on "Declarations" for more details.

    -  SUBSCRIPT CHECKING.  The CSPro compiler now issues warnings for unusual
       or improper use of subscripts.  This will help you find errors in your
       logic, avoid run-time errors, and help ensure that your applications
       work the way you want.

    -  REENGINEERED EXECUTION MODULES.  We've done a lot of work "under the
       hood" to improve the way CSPro runs your applications.  Several small
       bugs have been fixed and unusual behaviors corrected.


    CSPro (all modules)
    ===================
    -  MORE PRODUCTION SUPPORT.  We've standardized the Run Information files
      (.PFF) and provided more options for you to control the way CSPro data
       applications run.  You can now double click on any .PFF file and CSPro
       will execute it.

    -  BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY.  You can open any application created in
       CSPro 2.2 and run it in CSPro 2.3.  However, there are some differences
       between 2.2 and 2.3 that might affect the way your applications run.
       You may need to make some small modifications to your applications to
       make then run properly in 2.3.
